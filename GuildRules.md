# Ironwall Rules

## Expectations & Responsibilities Of Raiders

Raiders have to follow the rules listed below:
Prepared

- If you’re using some specific consumable for your spec you will have to bring it yourself. Feast and cauldron will be supplied at the raid.

## Communication & Voice chat

- You are required to join our Discord and join the raiding voice channel during raids. Furthermore, we’d appreciate it if you have a working microphone.
- The time for talking is not during the pull or progression content.
- If you have excessive noise in your surroundings, such as keyboard sounds or nearby family members, you have to make sure this is not picked up by your microphone during raids. If this is not possible you must use push/toggle to talk.

## Raid Schedule: Time & Date

- We raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
- Invites go out at 19:45, the raid starts at 20:00, and it ends at 23:00.
- All times are Server Time (GMT +1).
- Half way through the raid we have a 10 min break.

## Signups

- All eligible raiders are expected to be available by default and are therefore set to accept on all scheduled raid days in the in-game calendar.
- If you can’t make it to a scheduled raid you must set yourself to decline in the in-game calendar and send a reason for absence to an officer in a PM on discord.

## Attendance

- We expect core raiders to have close to 100% attendance.

## Pugging

- Pugging content that is currently under progression is not allowed, as you’d potentially slow down team progression.

## Addons

- The following addons are mandatory for raiding:
    1. You must have DBM/Bigwigs or another boss timer installed. (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/big-wigs)
    2. WeakAuras to complement certain strategies. (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2)
    3. Angry Assignments for setting up groups, interrupt rotations, etc. (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/angry-assignments)
    4. RCLootCouncil for loot distribution. (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil)
    5. If you have trouble with repeated fire stepping please consider GTFO. (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/gtfo)

## Loot System

In Battle for Azeroth the master loot option has been removed, meaning that all raids are forced to use personal loot. This will make loot distribution more tedious and confrontational. We will take in a couple of measures to make this as smooth as possible. This will be openly reviewed when we have more experience with the forced usage of personal loot. In BFA we tried just using a regular "roll-to-win" strategy, but this halted progression sometimes as trialists & inactive players got rewarded where consistent, active players didn't get to reap rewards to make progression easier.

We will start using the RCLootCouncil addon which has been adapted to personal loot. Every item that is looted and eligible for trading within the personal loot rules will automatically be put up for redistribution using the traditional RCLootCouncil session window where you have to choose main spec, off spec, etc. Loot will then be redistributed accordingly. The raider who looted a given item will be referred to as the looter.

Loot priority goes as normally: Raiders over trials, DPS over healers, etc. Outlier cases will be discussed as they occur. Furthermore, we have some measures to protect fairness for the looter:

- If the looter is a trial, then for that piece of loot the trial will be treated as a raider.
- If the piece of loot is an equal upgrade for the looter and one or more raiders, then the looter will be prefered to receive that piece of loot.
